# <PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO - MJ LEE>

## Description

The purpose of the assignment was to create the first draft of a working portfolio. The design was first wireframed by hand or on a digital application in order to visualize the placement of semantic HTML elements, flow, and structure. We implemented flexbox layouts in order to style text and images on the page. Media queries were used to optimize the layouts for smaller screens such as those for mobile devices.
